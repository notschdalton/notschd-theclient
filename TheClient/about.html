                            family of 4. Two gentlemen named Dylan and Dalton,
                            and
                            a gorgeously hansome husband
                            named Robert. She
                            loves

                            care
                            of her farm animals,
                            reading,
                            going on trips,
                            spending time with family.
                            and
                            her spending time with her new business. By day, she is a special education teacher for seventh graders, and by night she is a badass resurrector of ancient relics. </h3>
